# Rules

The BabyBench Competition aims to bring together researchers and students in the fields of robotics, machine learning, developmental psychology, and beyond. We welcome participants from all backgrounds, institutions, and levels of experience. There are no excluding criteria for participation—collaboration across disciplines and perspectives is strongly encouraged.

While the competition is open and inclusive by design, we strongly encourage submissions that align with the spirit of ICDL. This means a focus on modeling, understanding, or replicating infant learning and behavior through mechanisms that are plausible, interpretable, or relevant to developmental processes. We are particularly interested in approaches that bridge the gap between artificial and biological learning systems, drawing insights from cognitive development, neuroscience, and behavioral science.

Submissions may employ any modeling framework or data modality, but should aim to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of how learning unfolds in early development—whether through simulation, robotics, theoretical modeling, or analysis of behavioral data. We encourage submissions that are reproducible, open-source, and accessible to the broader research community.

To keep the competition simple, we do not require submissions to include the full code used to learn the behaviors. Only the winning team will be expected to provide the code, which will be tested as a verification check before the announcement.
