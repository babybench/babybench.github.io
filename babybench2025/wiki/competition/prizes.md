# Prizes

The winning team of the BabyBench Competition will receive a **€150 prize, generously sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society**. In addition to the monetary award, the winning team will be invited to **present their submission during the IEEE ICDL conference**, offering an opportunity to share their work with a broad interdisciplinary audience.

Finalist teams who make it to the final evaluation round will receive honorable mentions in recognition of their contributions. These mentions will be announced during the competition session and highlighted in official competition materials.

Our goal is to celebrate creativity, rigor, and developmental insight—whether you win, place, or simply participate, your work helps advance the conversation. We look forward to seeing your innovative approaches and the impact they will have on our understanding of infant learning and development.
