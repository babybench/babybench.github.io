MIMo is baby-sized humanoid model designed to mimic physical and sensory capabilities of a young infants. This features:
full body kinematics and dynamics.
Force based tactile sensitive skin
Proprioception and motor feedback (joint position, velocity, torque etc)
Simplified musculoskeletal structure and muscle like actuation model.

Actions space:
-Spring Damper model
-Muscle like actuation model (opposing controllable muscles)
-Predefined angle and power outputs limits.
Environmental Constraints:
Fixed gravity
Fixed body structure, masses and self-collisions
Time resolution
