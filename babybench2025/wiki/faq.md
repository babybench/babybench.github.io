## What is BabyBench?

BabyBench is a multimodal benchmark of infant behaviors for developmental artificial intelligence. The BabyBench Competition hosted at IEEE ICDL invites participants to model infant-like learning in simulated environments using MIMo.

## What is MIMo?

MIMo, the multimodal infant model, is a simulation platform based on the MuJoCo physics engine. You can found out more about MIMo [here](mimo/). You can also download and use MIMo for your own experiments [here](https://github.com/trieschlab/MIMo).

## Who can participate?

Anyone! Students, researchers, interdisciplinary teams—no matter your background, you’re welcome. If you're interested in developmental learning, this is for you.

## I don't have experience with reinforcement learning, can I still participate?

Absolutely, but training MIMo will require some basic knowledge of reinforcement learning. We recommend reading the [resources section](start/resources) or heading to the [discussion page on github](https://github.com/babybench/BabyBench2025) to connect with others.

## Are there any baseline models or starter code? 

Yes! We provide some basic examples with starter code to help you get up and running with training MIMo using reinforcement learning [here](start/examples).

## Are there restrictions on the algorithms or architectures I can use?

No, but we strongly encourage models that follow the spirit of the competition: unsupervised, self-supervised, or intrinsically motivated learning approaches that aim to recreate or explain developmental behaviors. Take into account that plausibility is one of the [evaluated criteria](competition/evaluation). Having said that, creativity and interpretability are valued! 

## What kind of submission is expected?

You’ll be asked to a 2-page abstract describing your approach, a log file automatically generated during training, and a video of the learned behavior. Details can be found [here](competition/submission).

## How will the winner be chosen?

Each submission will be scored out of 10 points, using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative criteria explained [here](competition/evaluation).

## What do I get if I win?

The winning team of the BabyBench Competition will receive a **€150 prize** and the opportunity to present their submission during the IEEE ICDL conference. 

## Can I publish work based on my BabyBench submission?

Yes, absolutely. Your BabyBench work can be a great foundation for a contribution to a conference or journal. We are working on a full version of the BabyBench platform in the fall of 2025. We’re happy to discuss follow-up opportunities!
